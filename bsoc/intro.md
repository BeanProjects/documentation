# Bean Summer of Code 2023 (BSoC)
## What is BSoC
Bean Summer of Code (BSoC) is an intensive coding program that facilitates "learning by doing" through an iterative and incremental process.

## What BSoC is NOT
1. Magical program whose members will automatically become competent at the end of the program.
2. One-on-one tutoring program.
3. Paid internship, but we do offer tiny "scholarship" for mental support.

## How it works
- The program lasts for 12 intensive weeks. Therefore, a member should commit to 6 hours a day, 5 days a week for 12 continuous weeks to complete this program.

- During this period, our members will work together towards building a Web Development business. 
   - We will be focusing only on 1 core service in this program which is to build a standard company website using GatsbyJS framework.

- There will be tasks for each week and you are required to pick a task to do before Monday of each week.

- It is expected that you may not have the required knowledge and skills to take on the task. That's why there will be documentation and guided tutorials for you to study.

- Everyday at 10AM, it's required of you to send a written **progress report** to the Telegram BSoC group using the following template.
   - What I have done: ... (skip this line if you haven't finished anything)
   - What I am doing/am about to do: ... (required, this program is intensive, so you must be doing something everyday)
   - What I am stuck at: ... (skip if you are not blocked by anything)
   - What I have tried to unblock myself: ... (skip if already skipped the point above)

- Every day at 3PM (or 4PM depending on the day), we will have a group conference to have spoken **progress reports** using the exactly same template as the written reports, but with **updated** content.
   - However, please note that the report must be delivered in English, so please prepare in advance what you are about to say.

- Every weekend, you must send a **weekly reflection** comprising of 4 sections. This reflective writing should not take you more than 1 hour to complete:

1) **Concrete Experience (doing - feeling)** This stage requires you to experience something. When it comes to a written reflection, this step usually involves a description of your experience and your thoughts at the time.
   - This is about what happened. What you did by yourself for the learning to occur.

2) **Reflective Observation (watching - looking back)** This stage requires you to think about the experience. Here you will begin to actually reflect upon that experience. The emphasis is on you, your feelings. What went well? What didn't go well?
   - Take a step back from doing to reflect on how and why things happened the way they happened as well as how they could be applied to different circumstances.

3) **Abstract Conceptualisation (thinking - conclusion)** This stage is all about learning from your experience. It requires you to analyse and explain your reflection. Here you should focus on the meaning of your reflection and other possibilities. You may identify areas for further exploration.
   - This is about fitting what you have learned into everything you already know and generalise it into a concept or pattern that can be applied according to some set of rules.
   - What could have been done differently to result in a better output?

4) **Active Experimentation (adaptation - doing again)** This final stage is about putting your learning into practice. This is about translating your analysis and explanation into plans and actions moving forwards. You should ensure any goals set are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and targeted.
   - This stage is also about going off to have new experiences based on this learning - linking you back to stage 1.
